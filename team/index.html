                        Guilherme has more than 10 years of software development experience. He is a co-founder
                        and CTO of LG7. Being an engineer and entrepreneur, he has a broad range of experience
                        in starting projects from scratch and dealing with all the challenges that come along with it.
                        He started his career as a software engineer at DTI Digital and went on founding Livobooks,
                        a mobile games producer with partnerships such as Discovery Kids and Animal Planet. With
                        his current partner at LG7, Guilherme started another business called ‘VG Resíduos’, a
                        waste management software that reduces environmental impact, lowers the risk to be
                        sanctioned and ultimately saves costs. The efficiency of VG Resíduos was recognized when
                        getting ranked 3rd by Brazil’s ‘Most Promising Startups’ ranking.. Guilherme holds a BSc in
                        Control and Automation Engineering.                        
                        <br /><br />At Auctus, he was chosen as the brain behind our platform, ensuring that our users have a
                        smooth experience managing their funds. Guilherme is also responsible to make the most of the transparency provided by the blockchain layer in order that data can be shown in the clearest possible way at the front-end.
